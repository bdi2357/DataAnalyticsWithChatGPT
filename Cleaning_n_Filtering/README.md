# Cleaning and Filtering Tools

## Overview
This repository, `cleaning_n_filtering`, is dedicated to providing robust and efficient tools for data cleaning and filtering, especially for tabular data analysis. It encompasses methods for data validation, outlier detection, and handling missing values, ensuring data quality and readiness for further analysis or machine learning applications.

## Features
- **Data Filtering**: Techniques for eliminating irrelevant or redundant data, including outlier detection using statistical methods like Z-score, IQR, and clustering algorithms.
- **Data Cleaning**: Procedures for data validation (range, format, list checks) and strategies for dealing with missing data, including various imputation techniques.

## Documentation
Detailed methodologies and usage examples are provided in the document: "Cleaning & Filtering in Tabular Data Analysis."

## Notebooks
- `ImputationPerformance.ipynb`: Analyzes the performance of various imputation methods.
- `Churn_filtering_n_cleaning.ipynb`: Demonstrates the application of filtering and cleaning in a churn prediction model.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance and expand the tools and methodologies are welcome. Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.
