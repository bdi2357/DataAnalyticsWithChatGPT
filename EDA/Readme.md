# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with ChatGPT

## Introduction
This guide provides instructions on how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on tabular data using the principles outlined in the "Tabular data Initial EDA" document, with the assistance of ChatGPT.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Data Analysis and Python.
- Access to ChatGPT or OpenAI's GPT API.

## Overview of EDA Steps
The document outlines the following key steps in EDA:
1. Data Quality Assessment
2. Statistical Summary and Interpretation
3. Data Visualization
4. Identification of Relationships Between Variables

## Using ChatGPT for EDA
ChatGPT can assist in each step by providing code snippets, statistical explanations, and insights into data relationships.

### Data Quality Assessment with ChatGPT
- Ask ChatGPT to suggest methods for identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data.

### Statistical Summary and Interpretation
- Use ChatGPT to generate Python code for statistical summaries.
- Get explanations for statistical results from ChatGPT.

### Data Visualization with ChatGPT
- Request specific types of visualizations from ChatGPT.
- Discuss with ChatGPT the implications of visual data trends.

### Identifying Relationships with ChatGPT
- ChatGPT can suggest appropriate statistical tests or data analysis techniques to uncover relationships between variables.

## Example Interaction
```
User: "How can I visualize the distribution of variable X in my dataset?"
ChatGPT: "You can use a histogram or a box plot to visualize the distribution. Here is a sample code snippet using matplotlib..."
```

## Conclusion
This guide helps in leveraging ChatGPT for conducting effective EDA based on the principles outlined in the "Tabular data Initial EDA" document.
