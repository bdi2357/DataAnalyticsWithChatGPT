## Data Cleaning with ChatGPT
ChatGPT assists in generating scripts for data cleaning, including quality enforcing, filtering, and imputing missing values.

### Quality Enforcing
- ChatGPT suggests techniques for ensuring data quality.

### Filtering
- ChatGPT helps to define filters based on data exploration.

### Imputing
- Strategies for missing data are suggested by ChatGPT.

## Data Encoding and Transformation
ChatGPT advises on the best practices for data encoding and transformation.

- One-Hot Encoding
- Label Encoding
- Feature Scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)

## Feature Engineering with ChatGPT
ChatGPT assists in identifying and creating valuable features.

- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- Domain-specific feature suggestions

## Model Selection and Cross-Validation
ChatGPT is utilized for model recommendations and setting up cross-validation processes.

- Data split strategies
- K-Fold cross-validation setup
- Model selection criteria discussion
